# 👋 Hey there, I'm Alessio Sclafani

📍 PhD student trying to make sense of problems using **data**, **algorithms** and a bit of **stubbornness**.  
🧠 I solve real-world problems mixing **math**, **code**, and **common sense**.  
🧰 My toolbox: **machine learning** and **mathematical optimization**.   

## What I believe

- Simpler is usually better   
- Real-world data won’t care about your 95% accuracy on Kaggle  
- If you don’t get the problem, the model won’t save you
